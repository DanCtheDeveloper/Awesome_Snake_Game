# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning


Game type: Snake Game
1 - Create Layout, Base HTML File, and design game function.
2 - Find necessary graphics and icons and apply to game, providing attributes as necessary.
3 - Decide on JavaScript Functions necessary for game and implement.
4 - Test code, ensure game is working.
5 - Beautify, adding background images or colors, etc.
Stretch Goals:
6 - If all is working, add new functions to the game, such as score, high score, etc.
7 - Add Sounds

--------

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://dancthedeveloper.github.io/Awesome_Snake_Game/>.


## Project Description

Fun Snake Game!  Using the arrows you will control the snake, with the goal of directing him to eat the food square.  When the food square is eaten, the snake grows longer, and you earn 10 points!  Be careful though, if the snake goes off the edge, or bites his tail, the game ends.


## Game Logic


  - Player can move in all directions on the board trying to eat the food.
  - Player grows in size with each piece of food consumed.
  - Player earns 10 points per food eaten.
  - High Score Record is kept.
  Game Over:
  - When the snake hits a wall.
  - When the snake bites himself.

## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!*



### MVP Criteria


- Snake must be able to be controlled, eat food, and grow.
- Game Over parameters must be set & work.
- Score and timer should be displayed.


### Post-MVP Plans



- Add high-score.
- Add music and sound effects.
- Record the high-score using "Local Storage".
